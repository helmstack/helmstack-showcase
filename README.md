# HelmStack Showcase

Welcome to the **HelmStack Showcase** repository!  
This repo contains interactive examples, demo scenarios, and preconfigured sessions that highlight the capabilities of HelmStack in real-world use cases.

The showcase is designed to **help new users, stakeholders, and contributors** quickly understand how HelmStack works in practice. Each demo demonstrates a particular aspect of the system — from AI-powered planning to collaborative workflows — so you can experience HelmStack as if it were running on your own terminal.
